✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve api`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build datn` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Git Flow Workflow

The Git Flow workflow consists of the following main branches and their purposes:

- `master`: Represents the stable production-ready code. Only merge releases into this branch.
- `develop`: Serves as the integration branch for ongoing development. Feature branches are merged into this branch.
- `feature`: Used to develop new features. Each feature should have its own branch branched off from `develop`.
- `release`: Created for preparing a new release. Bug fixes and last-minute changes can be made in this branch.
- `hotfix`: Created to quickly address critical issues in the production code. Branched off from `master`.

## Branches in Git Flow

In Git Flow, branches have specific naming conventions to indicate their purpose:

- Feature branch: `feature/<branch-name>`
- Release branch: `release/<version-number>`
- Hotfix branch: `hotfix/<branch-name>`

## Using Rebase in Git Flow

To incorporate rebase into the Git Flow workflow, follow these steps:

1. Start a new feature: Create a new feature branch from `develop`.
2. Work on the feature: Make commits to the feature branch as you develop the new feature.
3. Update the feature branch: Before completing the feature, rebase it onto the latest `develop` branch to incorporate the latest changes.
4. Resolve conflicts: If conflicts occur during the rebase process, resolve them by editing the conflicting files manually.
5. Complete the feature: Once the feature is complete and conflicts are resolved, merge the feature branch into `develop`.
6. Repeat the process: Continue working on new features or start a release/hotfix branch following the same principles.
